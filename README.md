# Predictive-Model
Churn Model for an online retailer.

In this model, we have labelled customers who have not purchased a product in the last 8 months as customers who have churned. This time period is decided independently, and should be adjusted depending on the sector. 

To retain such customers, the management needs quantifiable and timely metrics.

The Predictive Model will pattern habits of customers who have left in the past, and find similar patterns in existing customers, to send alerts if it finds that a customer is potentially going to leave
